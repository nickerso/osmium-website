Osmium is the software framework being developed to power the next generation `Physiome Model Repository <https://models.physiomeproject.org>`_ (PMR) and the VPH/PHYSIOME portal. Deployed instances of the Osmium framework provide collaborative repositories for archiving, sharing, discovering, reusing, and identifying computational models and associated data. Models and associated data encoded in standard formats can be discovered when placed in freely accessible repositories. Including comprehensive descriptions enables other scientists to reuse your work.

Osmium began as a refactoring of `PMR2 <http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btq723>`_, the software stack behind the second generation of PMR (the `CellML model repository <http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btn390>`_ being the first generation), and the additional new features to meet the growing demands for collaborative, reproducible, and reusable modelling in the Physiome/VPH communities. Supporting the PHYSIOME portal curation and publication workflows will, furthermore, require new features be implemented in Osmium beyond the current capabilities of PMR. Enabling the integration of models published in the PHYSIOME portal, and other collaborating community portals, will similarly require extensions to existing features in PMR and the addition of new features.
